How to run these benchmarks:

First, some prerequisites are:

* make
* gcc and recent g++ (4.3-ish?)
* python (hard-coded for 2.6 -- edit Makefile to use another version)
* glib
* boost
* google sparsehash
* qt

Now, run:

$ make
$ python bench.py
$ python make_chart_data.py < output | python make_html.py

Your charts are now in charts.html.

You can tweak some of the values in bench.py to make it run faster at the
expense of less granular data.
